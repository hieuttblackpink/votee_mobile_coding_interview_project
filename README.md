## Overview

The Wordle Game project is a mobile app where players can solve vocabulary puzzles by guessing the correct word within a limited number of tries. With a simple and user-friendly interface, players can enjoy this fun game right on their mobile devices.

## Main Features

- **Word Guessing**: Players guess a 5-letter word and receive feedback on the accuracy of each letter.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have only 6 tries to find the correct word.
- **Color Feedback**: Each letter in the guessed word changes color, helping players identify correct letters or incorrect positions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple yet engaging design to enhance player experience.

## Description

- **State Management**: The app uses the `provider` package for efficient and scalable state management.
- **Data Modeling**: The `freezed` package is used for defining immutable data classes and parsing JSON data, making the model layer clean and maintainable.
